# Soft Copy Edit 

---

## Purpose and Context

I used Track Changes in MS Word to copyedit sections from an archived Turkish Airlines webpage for my [soft copy edit assignment](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6b5zzggiy0scyo77aidlf/JGuinoiseau-Soft-Copy-Edit.docx?rlkey=8fdi9uk2q3nncyiy10ipffgkf&st=35fu6o6g&dl=0). The purpose was to develop copyediting skills. I also made queries to ask for clarification and to make comments for larger edits.

## Skills
- Track Changes in Microsoft Word
- Attention to detail
