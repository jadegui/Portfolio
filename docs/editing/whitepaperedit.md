# White Paper Edit 

---

## Purpose and Context

I edited a fellow studentâ€™s [white paper draft](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8h9u2v1eobuz5h9t8qtsv/JGuinoiseau-White-Paper-Edit.docx?rlkey=3ygi36e72lxo2mu4kqep5mwel&st=2uizd5ln&dl=0). The purpose was to apply copyediting techniques and practice effective communication with a writer during the editing process. Throughout the process, I listened to the writer's concerns. I tried to keep the balance of managing the white paper's audience understanding while keeping the draft concise.
