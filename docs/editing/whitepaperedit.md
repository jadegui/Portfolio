# White Paper Edit 

---

## Purpose and Context

I edited a fellow studentâ€™s white paper draft. The purpose was to apply copyediting techniques and practice effective communication with a writer during the editing process. Throughout the process, I listened to the writer's concerns. I tried to keep the balance of managing the white paper's audience understanding while keeping the draft concise.
