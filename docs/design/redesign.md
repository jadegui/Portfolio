## Purpose and Context

I applied visual design principles to re-design an event page for Spectrasonic, an Ottawa-based event promoter and manager. Here is the [original design](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pqidx0g6haymvkha2fs18/Design-Overview-Original-Jade-Guinoiseau-TWR2010.png?rlkey=aopvkf1gu9ocsw2v6nndxyy82&st=kvpii761&dl=0) and my [redesign](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/j67bv3tu3to2zf335ieu0/Design-Overview-Redesign-Jade-Guinoiseau-TWR2010.png?rlkey=b384hwkyndo4r1tx3jo4khlst&st=ketxyctf&dl=0). The purpose was to improve the user experience by enhancing readability, visual appeal, and information clarity.
