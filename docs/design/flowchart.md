## Purpose and Context

I created a [flowchart](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0w4ymuvsremoxhknye7tm/Jade-Guinoiseau-Flowchart-TWR-2010.png?rlkey=4mtng6fqwjhn7o1ler84lzgwc&st=kdu45q91&dl=0) to visually represent the steps for making a grilled cheese sandwich based on a provided set of instructions. The purpose was to practice designing clear and visually appealing flowcharts using standard shapes and conventions.
