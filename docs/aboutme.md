# About Me

My name is Jade Guinoiseau, and I'm from the New Jersey suburbs just outside of Philadelphia. In 2017, I moved to Canada to study at McGill University in Montreal, QC. After finishing my studies in 2020 (and a brief stint back home in NJ), I settled in Ottawa, where I now live with my partner and [our three sphynx (hairless) cats](/img/cats.jpg).

Currently, I am a technical writer student at Algonquin College. I'm passionate about taking complex information and making it into accessible and user-friendly content for the end-users.

When I'm not studying, I love to explore Ottawa's hidden gems, try new restaurants, and help organize fun events in the city.
