# About Me

---

I am a detail-oriented technical communicator, specializing in translating complex information into clear, accurate, user-centered documentation. My work focuses on creating structured content and technical diagrams that help customers understand our products. I work closely with subject matter experts to produce accurate and usable documentation. 

Outside of work, I enjoy cross country skiing, hosting a monthly community board game event, and taking care of my cats. These interests keep me active, connected, and attentive to the small details that matter.
