# About Me

---

My name is Jade Guinoiseau, and I'm from the New Jersey suburbs just outside of Philadelphia. In 2017, I moved to Canada to study at McGill University in Montreal, QC. After finishing my studies in 2020 (and a brief stint back home in NJ), I settled in Ottawa, where I now live with my partner and our three sphynx (hairless) cats.

Currently, I am a technical writer student at Algonquin College with an expected completion date in April 2025. I'm passionate about taking complex information and making it into accessible and user-friendly content.

In my free time, I love to explore Ottawa's hidden gems, try new restaurants, and help organize fun events in the city. 

Feel free to check out my resume or get in touch at guin0093@algonquinlive.com!
