## Purpose and Context

I wrote a [proposal](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/v20xqv5eg9osaa9arw530/JGuinoiseau-Proposal.pdf?rlkey=lr0mt8wksd2yo7hxrdh0628g9&st=tyklic77&dl=0) to address social media challenges faced by the Ottawa Chinese Community Service Centre (OCCSC). The proposal offers a solution to improve OCCSCâ€™s social media strategy. I recommended the implementation of a social media marketing and management tool to enhance the organization's reach and engagement.
