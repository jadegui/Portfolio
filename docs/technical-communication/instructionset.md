# Instruction Set

## Purpose and Context

I created a task-oriented instruction set to serve as a [quick reference guide](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1iy0p0ac0in0tdg3r4hh8/JGuinoiseau-Quick-Reference-Guide.pdf?rlkey=kx47uxjxye5p2ga6yuwxi002g&st=garoxd8v&dl=0) for technical writer students at Algonquin College. The purpose was to provide practical, step-by-step instructions for downloading Microsoft Project Professional 2019.

## Skills
- Writing task-oriented instructions
